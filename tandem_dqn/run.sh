# This script installs tandem_dqn in a clean virtualenv and runs an
# example training loop. It is designed to be run from the parent directory,
# e.g.:
#
# git clone git@github.com:deepmind/deepmind-research.git
# cd deepmind_research
# tandem_dqn/run.sh

# Fail on errors, display commands.
set -e
set -x

# Set up environment.
virtualenv --python=python3.6 "${TMP_DIR}/env"
source "${TMP_DIR}/env/bin/activate"

# Install deps.
pip install --upgrade -r tandem_dqn/requirements.txt

# Run small-scale example for a few thousand steps.
