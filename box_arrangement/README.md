# Predicate tasks.

This package contains tasks associated with "Behavior Priors for Efficient
Reinforcement Learning" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14274), "Exploiting Hierarchy
for Learning and Transfer in KL-Regularized RL" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14274)
and "Information asymmetry in KL-regularized RL"
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01240).
This is research code, and has dependencies on more stable code that is
available as part of [`dm_control`], in particular upon components in
[`dm_control.locomotion`] and [`dm_control.manipulation`].

To get access to preconfigured python environments for the tasks, see the
`task_examples.py` file. To use the MuJoCo interactive viewer (from dm_control)
to load the environments, see `explore.py`.

## Installation instructions

1.  Download [MuJoCo Pro](https://mujoco.org/) and extract the zip archive as
    `~/.mujoco/mujoco200_$PLATFORM` where `$PLATFORM` is one of `linux`,
    `macos`, or `win64`.

2.  Ensure that a valid MuJoCo license key file is located at
    `~/.mujoco/mjkey.txt`.

3.  Clone the `deepmind-research` repository:

    ```shell
       git clone https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research.git
       cd deepmind-research
    ```

4.  Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

    ```shell
       python3 -m virtualenv box_arrangement
       source box_arrangement/bin/activate
    ```

5.  Install the package:

    ```shell
       pip install ./box_arrangement
    ```

## Quickstart

To instantiate and step through the go to one of K targets task:

```python
from box_arrangement import task_examples
import numpy as np

# Build an example environment.
env = task_examples.go_to_k_targets()

# Get the `action_spec` describing the control inputs.
action_spec = env.action_spec()

# Step through the environment for one episode with random actions.
time_step = env.reset()
while not time_step.last():
  action = np.random.uniform(action_spec.minimum, action_spec.maximum,
                             size=action_spec.shape)
  time_step = env.step(action)
  print("reward = {}, discount = {}, observations = {}.".format(
      time_step.reward, time_step.discount, time_step.observation))
```

The above code snippet can also be used for other tasks by replacing
`go_to_k_targets` with one of (`move_box`, `move_box_or_gtt` and
`move_box_and_gtt`).

## Visualization

[`dm_control.viewer`] can be used to visualize and interact with the
environment. We provide the `explore.py` script specifically for this. If you
followed our installation instructions above, this can be launched for the
go to one of K targets task via:

```shell
python3 -m box_arrangement.explore --task='go_to_target'
```
